## Introduction
The idea from this project is from myself that can't wait for Engineering Registeration Department that works so slow and I want to renovate the old web which doesn't cover latest data.
So , It was developed to a brand new web application for 1st year General Engineering Student @ Chulalongkorn University to decide and calculate which department is the their best choice.

## Multiplier charts & 10-year back history of department choosing

## Cautions for using this calculator (Written in Excel)
- Use this carefully , **Don't be obsessed** with this program too much. It can leads to your mental heakth unintentionally.
- This program didn't consist of external factors (popularity , Seats for each department , Psychology game behind department choosing)
- **Georesources & Nuclear** Engineering are **NOT** in this program (because of unpopular department , info not covered 6-year (some year didn't aren't applicable via choosing department) )
- This program didn't contain **Safe Score** for each department (with this score , nisits can ensure that they have higher possibilities to get their dream department) [but in shhets have it]
- Opening google sheets in iPad can cause bug (shown as "Loading ...") . so , reopen it and it will shown your score

## 2 Methods of calculating **Minimum Score**
Well , I created 2 methods how to calculate score for each department.
  - The first nethod is **Average Minimum Score** which caculate 6-year back minimum score then find average of them
  - The second method is **Weightedd Minimum Score** . Because of Civil Engineering in 2023 having a bug score (7.5 points , which was retired from university) . So , I weigted score differently on each year
