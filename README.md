## Introduction
The idea from this project is from myself that can't wait for Engineering Registeration Department that works so slow and I want to renovate the old web which doesn't cover latest data.
So , It was developed to a brand new web application for 1st year General Engineering Student @ CHulalongkorn University to decide which department is the their best choice.
